# Building a .NET 6 API Using Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Purpose of the Study
This study is focused on learning how to develop a .NET 6 Web API using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. TDD is an approach where we write tests before writing the actual code, ensuring better code quality, maintainability, and reliability.

## Overview
Using the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ULJ3UEezisw) titled "Building a .NET 6 API Using TDD," I've created a .NET 6 Web API application from scratch using TDD practices. The video covers the following topics:

- Setting up a new solution and project structure.
- Adding web and unit test projects to the solution.
- Writing unit tests for our API using xUnit.
- Utilizing HttpClient for testing HTTP requests.
- Applying .NET Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC) principles.
- Understanding SOLID design principles for better software architecture.
- Developing RESTful APIs using the .NET 6 framework.
- Using the dotnet CLI for building and managing the project.
